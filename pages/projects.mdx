Following Angular's tutorial to make a sample cart app was a breeze, but testing concepts got real when I paired it with a Frontend Mentor challenge.

### Challenges

2. Subscribing to input changes
3. Handling forms 😅

Taking the traditional medical consultation and giving it a bookworm twist, <a href="https://prescribemebooks.caye.codes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prescribe Me Books ↗</a> starts with the user presenting with a "chief complaint", which Dr Libby then probes about and eventually prescribes books for.

3. Data is pulled from Airtable CMS via gatsby-source-airtable, with rich text formatted via gatsby-transformer-remark
