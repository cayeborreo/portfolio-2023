Hi, I'm **Caye** and I'm a **full-stack web developer since 2018**.

- My main stack is HTML/CSS/Javascript (ReactJS, NodeJS/Express, GraphQL), and occasionally Python (Django).
- Professionally, I've helped build web experiences for corporate healthcare services (e-pharmacy, clinic logs, appointment systems) and telco industry-focused CRM tools.
- **I like building side projects and writing what I learn.** Take a look at my [projects](/projects) and <a href="https://mcborreo.medium.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Medium articles â†—</a>.

If you'd like to reach out, email me at [hello@caye.codes â†—](mailto:hello@caye.codes).
