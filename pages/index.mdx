Hi, I'm **Caye** and I'm a **full-stack web developer since 2018**.

- My main stack is HTML/CSS/Javascript (ReactJS, NodeJS/Express, GraphQL), and occasionally Python (Django).
- Professionally, I've helped build web experiences for corporate healthcare services (e-pharmacy, clinic visits tracking, appointment systems) and telco industry-focused CRM tools.
- **I like building side projects and writing what I learn.** I learned how to use CMS like Prismic, UI/UX tools like Figma & Adobe XD, other frameworks like Angular, and platforms like Netlify & Heroku by building my own websites from scratch. Feel free to see my [projects](/projects) and [Medium articles](https://mcborreo.medium.com).

If you'd like to reach out, email me at [hello@caye.codes](mailto:hello@caye.codes).
